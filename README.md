# Biomass-based Activated Carbon (BAC) Capacitance and Rate Capability Prediction

## Overview

This web app allows users to predict the specific capacitance and rate capability of BAC electrodes based on various input parameters. The ANN model used in this project is pre-trained, and the app facilitates an easy-to-use interface where users can provide data related to material properties, activation conditions, and more. This project uses a pre-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict the specific capacitance and rate capability of biomass-based activated carbon (BAC) electrodes. The system is built using **Streamlit**, a Python web framework that allows users to input various parameters related to BAC synthesis and predict its electrochemical performance.
