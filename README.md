Biomass resources have gained significant attention as sustainable precursors for synthesizing
activated carbons (ACs) used in supercapacitor electrodes. The performance of these carbon-based
electrodes depends on several factors, including the activation procedure, structural features, electrode
synthesis parameters, and operational conditions. Machine learning, particularly Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs), offers a promising approach to understanding and predicting how these factors
influence electrode capacitance.

Your task is to develop a machine learning model to predict the specific capacitance of biomass-
based activated carbon (BAC) electrodes using a provided dataset. The dataset contains

quantitative and qualitative variables related to activation processes, structural features, electrode
synthesis parameters, and operational conditions.
